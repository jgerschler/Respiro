# Respiro
Graphic Serial Monitor for Abnormal Pulmonary Status (COPD, Bronchitis, Asthma)

This is a work in progress, utilizing Qt (via PyQt5) for the GUI and a serial interface pulling data from a respiration monitor belt and a pulse oximeter.

This program will provide a live update of respiratory status and provide notifications with SpO2, pulse or respiratory rate are outside the norm.
